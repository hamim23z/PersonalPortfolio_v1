This is the first project for the Software Engineering Fellowship at Headstarter. The purpose of this project was to build a personal website that showcases my skills and experiences, along with projects and anything else that I wanted to add. 

The languages that I used for my Personal Portfolio Website was simple, just HTML and CSS. I didn't dive deep into Javascript and React mainly because I am a bit rusty in terms of web development. So I'll do what Yasin said, make different versions of my Portfolio as time goes on. This is my Personal Portfolio - Version 1.
